This is a list of things I wanted to get done but haven't had the time to do yet:

1. /accounts/owners/(id)?type=(typeId)
2. Further abstracting the FrontController logic
3. Making it so non-employee users can only create Pending accounts
4. Added more exceptions with more specific explanations what went wrong
5. Adding the 'View' part
